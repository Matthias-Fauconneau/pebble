//! The HAL memory API tries to model an abstract version of a sensible architecture's virtual memory model. It
//! should be suitable for implementations for x86_64, AArch64, and paged RISC-V.
//!
//! It assumes two address spaces, the physical and the virtual (each of which have an address type). Physical
//! memory is split into frames, while virtual memory is split into pages. A `Mapper` can be used to map parts of
//! the virtual address space into the physical address space.
