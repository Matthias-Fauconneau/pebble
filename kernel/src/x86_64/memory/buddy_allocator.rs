//! This module implements a buddy allocator, an efficient method for managing physical memory. In
//! this allocator, memory is broken up into a number of blocks, each of which is a power-of-2 in
//! size. A block of size `2^^n` frames is said to be of order `n`:
//!
//!       16                               0       Order       Size of blocks
//!        |-------------------------------|
//!        |               8               |       4           2^^4 = 16
//!        |---------------|---------------|
//!        |      12       |       4       |       3           2^^3 = 8
//!        |-------|-------|-------|-------|
//!        |  14   |  10   |   6   |   2   |       2           2^^2 = 4
//!        |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
//!        |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |       1           2^^1 = 2
//!        |-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
//!        | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |       0           2^^0 = 1
//!        |-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
//!
//! The blocks at each order are arranged in pairs - each has a "buddy" where A's buddy is B and
//! B's buddy is A. The address of a block's buddy can be efficiently calculated using XOR (see the
//! `buddy_of` function). Blocks are stored in bins, where each bin contains blocks of a single
//! order.
//!
//! When an allocation is requested, the allocator looks in the bin of the correct size. If a block
//! is available, that block is removed from the bin and returned. If no blocks of the correct size
//! are available, a block of the order above the one requested is removed from its bin, split into
//! two blocks of the order requested (which are "buddies" of each other), of which one is returned
//! and one is added to the correct bin. If no blocks of the larger order are available, this
//! process continues recursively upwards to larger and larger block sizes, until a free block is
//! found. If no block is found, an "out of memory" error is issued.
//!
//! When a block is "freed" (returned to the allocator so that it can be allocated again), the
//! allocator checks to see if its "buddy" is also free. If it is, the two blocks of order `x` are
//! merged into a single block of order `x + 1`. This process continues upwards recursively until a
//! block's buddy is allocated (this can also occur before the first merging, and the freed block
//! is immediately added to the bin for order `x`), at which point no further merging can happen
//! and the block is added to the correct bin.
//!
//! Overall, the buddy allocator is an efficient allocator that has a much lower cost than other
//! algorithms such as first-fit. It also helps reduce external fragmentation, but can suffer from
//! internal fragmentation in the case of allocations that are slightly larger than a block size
//! (e.g. allocating 17 frames actually returns 32, wasting 15 frames). If the kernel needs to make
//! many allocations of a constant, "known bad" size (e.g. 3 frames at a time), it would be better
//! served allocating a larger block of frames at a time, and using a slab allocator to make the
//! individual allocations.
