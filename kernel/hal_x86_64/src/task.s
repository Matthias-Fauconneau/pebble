/*
 * Used to enter a task for the first time.
 * 
 * For sysret, we need:
 *     - `rcx` to contain the instruction pointer to enter userspace at
 *     - `r11` to contain the flags we want to enter with
 *
 * Neither of these are saved by the context switch, so we instead use registers that are:
 *     - `r15` is moved into `rcx`
 *     - `r14` is moved into `r11`
 *
 * We also need to switch to the task's user stack, which is expected to be in `r13`.
